Could find the build directory in the root directory of the project => turned that the configuration of the truffle unbox react already put the built json file into the a contract directory in the client/src directoty and wired it up accordingly.
Encounter issue with react watchify the solution is here => https://klequis.io/error-enospc-system-limit-for-number-of-file-watchers-reached/
Also had another issue with truffleContract not define => Turns out that npm install truffle-contract need to be ran to install the plugin and then truffleContract imported from truffle-contract


It works!
